Restaurant Recommendation App
Welcome to the Restaurant Recommendation App! This application leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized dining suggestions based on your preferences. Whether you're craving a specific cuisine, looking for a restaurant nearby, or sticking to a budget, this app has you covered.

🚀 Project Overview
The Restaurant Recommendation App uses cosine similarity to analyze various factors such as cuisine type, location, and price range. By understanding your preferences, it delivers tailored restaurant recommendations that suit your taste and needs.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project is built using a robust stack of data science and web development tools:

Python: The core programming language for data processing and algorithm implementation.
Streamlit: Provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface for rapid development and deployment.
Pandas & NumPy: Used for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Implements the TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculation for the recommendation engine.

✨ Key Features
Interactive User Interface: Input your preferences easily through a clean and intuitive interface.
Real-Time Recommendations: Get personalized dining suggestions instantly.
Customizable Filters: Adjust filters for cuisine type, location, and budget to refine your results.
Detailed Restaurant Information: View comprehensive details about each recommended restaurant.

📊 How It Works
Data Preprocessing:
The app uses a dataset of restaurants with details like cuisine type, location, and price range.
TF-IDF vectorization is applied to textual data (e.g., cuisine descriptions).

Recommendation Engine:
Cosine similarity is calculated between user preferences and restaurant data.
The most similar restaurants are recommended in real-time.

Interactive Filters:
Users can refine results by adjusting filters for cuisine, location, and budget.

🛠️ Future Enhancements
Add user authentication for saving preferences.
Integrate real-time restaurant reviews and ratings.
Expand dataset to include more cities and cuisines.
Implement a map view for location-based recommendations.
